Vandit Shah's Portfolio Website
===============================

![Portfolio Preview](https://vandit-shah.me/images/og-image.png)\

A modern, single-page portfolio website built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, showcasing my skills, projects, and journey as a full-stack web developer. This project is designed to be easily customizable via a data.json file, allowing anyone to adapt it for their own portfolio by simply updating the data.

üöÄ Features
-----------

-   **Modern Techy Theme**: Dark background with purple accents, monospaced fonts, and gradient borders for a developer-centric aesthetic.
-   **SEO Optimized**: Includes meta tags, schema markup, and a sitemap for better search engine ranking (e.g., optimized for "Vandit Shah").
